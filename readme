# Trice (incomplete!)

# Note: add ranger config from ThinkCenterm m710q.(wallpaper setting )
# modify vimwiki to point to Document/Notes instead of home folder

My Arch linux configuration files, specifically for i3 window manager.
Majority of this config is derived from Luke Smith's i3wm configuration[https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice].
I have added a lot of tweaks to better suit my need.
Named Trice because i use two machines, a desktop pc 'Lenovo ThinkCenter' and a laptop 'Lenovo ThinkPad', hence "Trice" !! Don't judge.

Configuration:
Even though i use i3-gaps i have no gaps enabled at default!!
I feel gaps are a waste of space especially when i am working, and going fullscreen each time is too bothersome.
I use Luke's build of "st" terminal emulator. The bindings are super easy once you figure them out and it has cool exclusive features added by Luke himself.

i3-movement:
I have remaped $mod+h/j keys to move left(horizontal) and $mod+k/l to move up(vertical).It just feels right. Your finger will be on 'j' most of the time, most of the time when you open a window it will be a second window to your right, you will feel the need to go to the left window, thus the 'j'.
