# Trice (incomplete!)
My Arch linux configuration files, specifically for i3 window manager.
Majority of this config is derived from Luke Smith's i3wm configuration[https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice].
I have added a lot of tweaks to better suit my need.
Named Trice because i use two machines, a desktop pc 'Lenovo ThinkCenter' and a laptop 'Lenovo ThinkPad', hence "Trice" !! Don't judge.

Dependencies:
	i3-gaps,"i3 window manager but with gaps!",
	i3-bar, "status bar for i3"
	sxhkd,"simple x hot key daemon. for key bindings unrelated to i3"
	dmenu,
	xcompmgr,"compositor to handle screen tearing" //may change to compton later
	mpd, "music player daemon"
	ncmpcpp, "terminal based music player"
	ranger,"terminal based file manager"
	conky,"system monitor"


Configuration:
Even though i use i3-gaps i have no gaps enabled at default!!
I feel gaps are a waste of space especially when i am working, and going fullscreen each time is too bothersome.
I use Luke's build of "st" terminal emulator. The bindings are super easy once you figure them out and it has cool exclusive features added by Luke himself.

i3-movement:
I have remaped $mod+h/j keys to move left(horizontal) and $mod+k/l to move up(vertical).It just feels right. Your finger will be on 'j' most of the time, most of the time when you open a window it will be a second window to your right, you will feel the need to go to the left window, thus the 'j'.
