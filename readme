# Trice (incomplete)
My Arch linux configuration files, specifically for i3-gaps window manager.
Major reference taken from Luke Smith.
Added tweaks to his coniguration to better suit my needs.
Named Trice because i use two machines, a desktop pc 'Lenovo ThinkCenter' and a laptop 'Lenovo ThinkPad', hence "Trice"

Dependencies:
	i3-gaps,"i3 window manager but with gaps",
	sxhkd,"simple x hot key daemon. for key bindings unrelated to i3"
	xcompmgr,"compositor" //may change to compton later
	ranger,"terminal based file manager"
	
Optional Dependencies:
	stow,"to install dot files"
