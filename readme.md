# Trice!!!! Nearing Perfection

## My Arch linux configuration files, specifically for i3 window manager.
Majority of this config is derived from [Luke Smith's i3wm configuration](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice).\
I have derived my config from a lot of different [sources](sources.md).\
I have made a lot of major changes.
Named Trice because i use two machines, a desktop pc 'Lenovo ThinkCenter' and a laptop 'Lenovo ThinkPad', hence "Trice"!!(Also because i could not think of anything else).\

## Configuration:
Even though i use i3-gaps i have no gaps enabled at default!!\
I feel gaps are a waste of space especially when i am working, and going fullscreen each time is too bothersome.\

## Applications
List of applications i use. See applications.csv

## i3-movement:
Note: this is the originallmapping of i3. except h and l are not mapped
(I have remaped `$mod+h/j` keys to move left(horizontal) and `$mod+k/l` to move up(vertical).\
It just feels right.\)
(Your finger will be on 'j' most of the time, most of the time when you open a window it will be a second window to your right, you will feel the need to go to the left window, thus the 'j'.\)
Although i may change this later on.\
