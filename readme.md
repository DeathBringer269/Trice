# Trice!!!! Nearing Perfection
<span style="color:blue">TESTING</span>

## My Arch linux configuration files, specifically for i3 window manager.
### Note: See [commands](commands.csv) for list of bindings.
Majority of this config is derived from [Luke Smith's i3wm configuration](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice).\
I have derived my config from a lot of different [sources](sources.md).\
I have made a lot of major changes.
Named Trice because i use two machines, a desktop pc 'Lenovo ThinkCenter' and a laptop 'Lenovo ThinkPad', hence "Trice"!!(Also because i could not think of anything else).\

## Configuration:
Even though i use i3-gaps i have no gaps enabled at default!!\
Working with i3 for a lot of time I feel gaps are just a waste of space, i had the need to go fullscreen a lot of times which is too bothersome. I have a special mapping to enable gaps temporarily for a session.\

## Applications
List of applications i use. See [applications](applications.csv).

## Preview

## Usability.
### Note: All keys are preceded by $mod/Super/etc...\
### Reload i3 is mapped to $mod+F12\
#### See [commands](commands.csv) for complete list of bindings.\
I use original i3 bindings for moving around windows, `j` to move horizontally and `k` to move vertically.\
Additionally i have mapped `h` and `l` to do the same.\
The arrow keys perform the same action `left`,`up`,`down`,`right` to move `left`,`up`,`down`,`right` respectively.\
